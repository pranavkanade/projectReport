\subsection{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problem}
Design a system which accepts an algebric word problem
as an input and classifies it into pre-defined domain
(e.g. Part-Part-Whole, Join-Seperate, Comparison, Equal 
Groups, Multiplicative-Compare etc.) using NLP (Information 
Extraction) and Machine Learning Techniques. Also generting 
equations for these problems and solving them automatically.

\subsection{Abstract}
\label{sec:Abstract}
Automatic Mathematical Word Problem Solver serves two purposes: First is in Intelligent Tutoring Systems and Second is in Cognitive Science to
study way of thinking to solve these problems in children. To solve a
MWP, First we need to classify the given problem into either Joint and
Seperate problem or Part-Part-Whole problem or Compare problem. After
clssification is done we need to recognize the function of each sentence
and extract information from them. This extracted feature is finally used
to form equations and then equations are solved to obtain the solution.Sothe proposed system consists of following main modules: Classification,
Information Extraction, Equation Generator and Equation Solver.


\subsection{Goals and Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Building assistant tool for students to solve algebric word problems
